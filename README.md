# The-Gaming-Room

The gaming Room is a company that only has an app version of this game. The game is a multiplayer experience, allowing users to guess on constantly clarifying images in a short time span. They wanted us to build a cross-platform pc version of the game. In the documentation I feel that my recommendations are especially done well because of my prior knowledge on the subject. I have personally developed and researched the development of web applications for years now. When looking at software design document gives the developer a clear picture of what they are fixing and developing. This helps streamline the process, rather than going through the code and discovering what is wrong we just already know where to go. If there was one part of my work on these documents, I could change it would be the UML diagram. I would make it more detailed, so that it could represent the full-scale commercial application. I feel that interpreting the user’s needs is simple once you put yourself in their shoes. This is so important because the user experience determines whether they will come back and ultimately the fate of the company. When designing software, I take into account the client’s and user needs. To future analyze software or design software, I would use UML diagrams. I feel that they really simplify the work of  software developer.
